## Introduction

This project addresses a critical challenge in wildlife conservation: the rapid and accurate identification of endangered species through image classification. By leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we aim to develop a robust system that can automatically classify species as endangered or non-endangered based on their visual characteristics.

The ability to quickly identify endangered species is crucial for conservation efforts, as it enables:
- Rapid assessment of species status in the field
- Efficient monitoring of endangered populations
- Early detection of species at risk
- Support for conservation decision-making

## Background

### The Conservation Challenge
Wildlife conservation faces numerous challenges, including:
- Limited resources for field monitoring
- Time-consuming manual species identification
- Difficulty in tracking endangered species populations
- Need for rapid response to conservation threats

### Technological Solution
Deep learning, particularly image classification, offers a promising solution to these challenges by:
- Automating species identification
- Processing large volumes of image data
- Providing real-time classification capabilities
- Reducing human error in species identification

### Dataset
The project utilizes the "Rare Species" dataset from Hugging Face, which contains:
- Images of both endangered and non-endangered species
